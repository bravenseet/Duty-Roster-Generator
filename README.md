# Introduction
This project was created during my tenure as Prefect's Council EXCO, where I faced an issue in creating duty rosters. Previously it was done by hand and was very tedious, hence I automated the generation to make it better for future EXCO to use

# Usage
```m.py``` contains the backend code for generating the roster
```main.py``` generates the frontend form UI for data to be input

Simply run the ```main.py``` and fill in the necessary blanks
